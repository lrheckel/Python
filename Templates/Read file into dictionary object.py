Essentially you will need to process a list and create a dictionary.  The dictionary is really the only thing new here and my slides specifically show how to create a dictionary.
so let's break down the problem
# From the lines variable you set in part 3, set the sixth line to the variable line. This should be the entry for Thor Odinson. From this entry, we will create
# a dictionary with information from this line in the CSV file.
If you did question 3 you should have something along the lines of this:
with open('avengers_utf8.csv') as f:
   lines = f.readlines()
all this does is open the file and then calls readlines to read the lines and store them in a variable called lines
the next thing we need to do is to get the 6th line using it's index like this:
line = lines[5]
then since this is a csv files or comma-delimited file we need to split the line using the comma in order to get values that we can use to create the dictionary.
values = line.split(',')
so now we have values that we can use to create the dictionary.  This is nothing fancy here
# Create the dictionary using the values we got from splitting the line ...............................
record = dict(
   url=values[0],
   name_alias=values[1],
   appearances=int(values[2]),
   is_current=(values[3].upper() == 'YES'),
   gender=values[4],
   year=int(values[7]),
   years_since_joining=int(values[8])
)
